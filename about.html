		<h1><em>WHO AM I</em></h1>

		<p>My name is Anant Singh, and I am a rising sophomore pursuing a bachelor of arts in computer science at the University of Rochester. I was born and raised in Washington and graduated from University Prep in Seattle. Ever since I was young I was attracted to three things: Building things, the arts, and sports. These three passions have shaped who I am today and reflect in my work whether it be a website I create or the way I approach a difficult problem.</p>

		<p>In our ever-advancing world, the need for someone who can beautifully craft a chair is diminishing, but the demand for someone who can program a machine to build a chair is increasing. When I first came to this realization I resented this fact. Building things with your hands and carefully crafting something was the only way that seemed pure to me. It has always been a passion of mine to build things, and for this reason I was initially put off by computer science. It seemed so boring, just sitting and typing. How could that ever be as fun as using a table saw?  However, growing up in Redmond and being surrounded by Microsoft and other tech startups it was impossible to escape the world of computer science. So, I experimented with it. To no surprise, I still thought it was the most boring thing in the world. That’s why I went to college with the idea that I would become a mechanical engineer. 

		<p>After a long road of indecision in my first semester of college switching from mechanical engineering, to the study of optics, to sitting in economic classes I was completely confused with what I wanted to do. But by the time second semester rolled around, I was sitting in CSC 170, otherwise known as Web Design and Development. It was like I could never escape it. This was the first time I was exposed to front end development and fell in love with it. This was the first time I understood the beauty of computer science. I thought back to my initial thoughts on building things and realized how wrong I was. I was looking at it from the wrong angle. While I’m not cutting, sanding, and dying wood physically, I am applying the same principles to a web page. The first thing a chair needs is structure, second is functionality, and finally appeal. This is exactly what I’m doing with my webpages. I first start with my HTML and create the frame work for my website. I then implement JavaScript and make the website come alive, it becomes functional. I then “paint” my website with CSS and make it beautiful. I realized I couldn’t resent the world for moving on and advancing its technologies, instead I could embrace it and make it my own.</p>

 		<p>Just as code was flying around my head in Redmond, every day at 7:30am I’d cross the 520 bridge and enter a world of artistic beauty and influence. Having art all around me in high school led me to realize the creative possibility computer science holds. The ability to modify, design, and create with my laptop blew my mind. I again had a realization that creating a website was just the same as creating a piece of art. I was always struggling and fighting the world on its technological changes because I thought if I went along with it I would lose my passions, when I was in fact so wrong. Creating websites and webpages allows me combine all my passions of art and building, while keeping up to date with the world. I would call my new passion making beautiful websites, but this again constrains me to a single era and timeframe. Who knows what the world will be like in 30 years, instead I simply call this newfound passion.<em>Creating</em>.
