					<h3>Who is Elon Musk?</h3>

						<p> Elon musk is a South African born inventor credited with the foundation of multiple successful companies. While he was born in South Africa he moved to the United States in 1995, and became a U.S. citizen in 2002.
						</p>

						<h3>Companies Founded</h3>
						<h4>Zip2</h4>

						<p>The first company founded by Musk was Zip2. Zip2 was founded by Elon Musk and his brother Kimbal Musk in 1995. Zip2 was a software company whose primary product was a way to provide newspapers with an online presence. This software allowed for users to communicate with advertisers. Zip2 went on to acquire over 160 contracts with various newspapers, with the New York Times being one of them. Eventually Zip2 was bought by Compaq for $307 million dollars.

						<p>Elon musk realized there was a lack of a solid online banking platform. To solve this problem, he created X.com, an online payment platform. X.com was founded in 1999 using money Musk had made from the sale of Zip2. About a month later X.com merged with a company called coinfinity. From that PayPal was created. PayPal exploded in popularity and was eventually bought by eBay, with Musk transferring over control of the company. PayPal is still a very popular service, with 6.1 billion transactions over the last year adding up to 345 billion dollars of transactions. PayPal is also responsible for the popular money sharing service Venmo.</p>

						<h4>Space X</h4>
						<p>The next company founded by Musk was spaceX. In 2001, Musk conceptualized "Mars Oasis"; a project to land a miniature experimental greenhouse on Mars, containing food crops growing on Martian regolith, in an attempt to regain public interest in space exploration. In October 2001, Musk travelled to Moscow with Jim Cantrell (an aerospace supplies fixer), and Adeo Ressi (his best friend from college), to buy refurbished ICBMs (Dnepr) that could send the envisioned payloads into space. The group met with companies such as NPO Lavochkin and Kosmotras, however, according to Cantrell, Musk was seen as a novice and was consequently spat on by one of the Russian chief designers, and the group returned to the United States empty-handed. The group met again with Kosmotras, and were offered one rocket for US$8 million, however, this was seen by Musk as too expensive; Musk consequently stormed out of the meeting. On the flight back from Moscow, Musk realized that he could start a company that could build the affordable rockets he needed. According to early Tesla and SpaceX investor Steve Jurvetson, Musk calculated that the raw materials for building a rocket actually were only 3 percent of the sales price of a rocket at the time. With US$100 million of his early fortune, Musk founded Space Exploration Technologies, or SpaceX, in May 2002. The company's first two launch vehicles are the Falcon 1 and Falcon 9 rockets (a nod to Star Wars' Millennium Falcon), and its first spacecraft is the Dragon (a nod to Puff the Magic Dragon).  In September 2008, SpaceX's Falcon 1 rocket became the first privately funded liquid-fueled vehicle to put a satellite into Earth orbit. On May 25, 2012, the SpaceX Dragon vehicle berthed with the ISS, making history as the first commercial company to launch and berth a vehicle to the International Space Station. Musk's goal is to reduce the cost of human spaceflight by a factor of 10. In a 2011 interview, he said he hopes to send humans to Mars' surface within 10–20 years. In Ashlee Vance's biography, Musk stated that he wants to establish a Mars colony by 2040, with a population of 80,000.  Space X intends to launch a Dragon spacecraft on a Falcon Heavy in 2018 to soft-land on Mars - this is intended to be the first of a regular cargo mission supply-run to Mars building up to later crewed flights. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk">("Elon Musk" n.d.)</a></p>

						<p>But what really sets SpaceX apart, and has made it a magnet for controversy, are its prices: As advertised on the company’s Web site, a Falcon 9 launch costs an average of $57 million, which works out to less than $2,500 per pound to orbit. That’s significantly less than what other U.S. launch companies typically charge, and even the manufacturer of China’s low-cost Long March rocket (which the U.S. has banned importing) says it cannot beat SpaceX’s pricing. By 2014, the company’s next rocket, the Falcon Heavy, aims to lower the cost to $1,000 per pound. And Musk insists that’s just the beginning. “Our performance will increase and our prices will decline over time,” he writes on SpaceX’s Web site, “as is the case with every other technology.” Like the Chinese, many observers in this country are wondering how SpaceX can deliver what it promises. <a href="http://www.airspacemag.com/space/is-spacex-changing-the-rocket-equation-132285884/">(Chaikin, Is SpaceX Changing the Rocket Equation?)</a>

						<h4>Tesla</h4>
						<p>While Elon musk did not found Tesla Motors, he is in large responsible for its success. Tesla Inc. (originally Tesla Motors) was incorporated in July 2003 by Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning, who financed the company until the Series A round of funding. Both men played active roles in the company's early development prior to Elon Musk's involvement. Musk led the Series A round of investment in February 2004, joining Tesla's board of directors as its chairman. Musk took an active role within the company and oversaw Roadster product design at a detailed level, but was not deeply involved in day-to-day business operations.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk">("Elon Musk" n.d.)</a> The company was initially founded in 2003 by Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning, although the company also considers Elon Musk, JB Straubel, and Ian Wright amongst its co-founders. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla,_Inc.">(“Tesla Inc” n.d.)</a></p>

						<p>In October 2008, Musk succeeded Drori as CEO. Drori became Vice Chairman, but then left the company in December. By this time Musk had dumped $70 million of his own money into Tesla.On June 30th, 2008, Tesla unveiled the Model S — the first car they’d really come to be known for. With a starting price of $50,000 and seating for seven, the Model S was supposed to be Tesla’s more “affordable” family sedan. Tesla unveiled its first SUV and AWD vehicle on February 9, 2012, the Model X, with delivery (originally) expected for late 2013. The stunning gullwing-type doors featured in the concept will be included in the production vehicle. In the middle of 2014, Tesla announced that it would be using everything it’s learned about making cars so far to introduce a significantly more affordable model. Called the Model 3, it’s estimated starting price will be under $35,000.<a href="https://techcrunch.com/gallery/a-brief-history-of-tesla">(Kumpark, A brief history of Tesla)</a></p>

						<p>In 2014, Musk announced that Tesla would allow its technology patents to be used by anyone in good faith in a bid to entice automobile manufacturers to speed up development of electric cars.

				<h4>SolarCity</h4>

				<p>In 2006, Elon Musk, gave some business suggestions to his cousins Peter and Randon Rive. In an interview with the New York Times, Rive recalls how Musk advised them to investigate clean energy and the business prospects therein. Consequently, they started SolarCity in order to navigate away from fossil fuels.

				</p>

				<p>In 2010, the company expanded its client base and started shying away from being confined to providing services to the homeowners. In this regard, its target audience was expanded to include the government, businesses, and the non-profit organizations. In the month of May of the same year, the company completed the largest solar installation in San Francisco.

				</p>

				<p>The future of SolarCity will be follow another direction now that the company has partnered with Tesla to provide battery solutions. The greatest advantage with the partnership is that the Musk has the capital to inject in any valid business venture. Tesla has the advantage of having a strong reputation in electric cars. Its role in the automotive industry has translated to very strong efficiency in battery making. The duo will be in a position to command a higher share of the market due to their valuable input from each partner.
