Project 2 
*Code from lecture was borrowed for this assignment* 

Implementation of a Huffman Encoding program. 

Private static classes have been used to help write the encode and decode methods.
Most of the code has been explained in the comments. In order to run the project on the 
command terminal use the following commands:

javac HuffmanSubmit.java
java HuffmanSubmit.

The main code structure was put together by using code found from the lectures, and modifying it not only read text files in a single line but full binary pages instead.
